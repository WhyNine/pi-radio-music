# pi-radio-music
Project for Raspberry Pi to play radio and Plex playlists

The set-up is a Raspberry Pi with a small DFR0928 160 x 128 pixel display from DFRobot and four coloured buttons as input (green, red, yellow and blue).

The UI allows for the user to select a radio station or a music playlist, scraped from a Plex server. The audio is played on an external Bluetooth speaker.

The buttons are used as follows:
* green = play / skip
* red = stop / switch between radio and playlist mode
* yellow = up
* blue = down
