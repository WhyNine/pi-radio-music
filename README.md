# pi-radio-music
Project for Raspberry Pi to play radio and Plex playlists

The set-up is a Raspberry Pi with a small 160 x 128 pixel display and four coloured buttons as input (green, red, yellow and blue).

The UI allows for the user to select a radio station or a music playlist, scraped from a Plex server.
